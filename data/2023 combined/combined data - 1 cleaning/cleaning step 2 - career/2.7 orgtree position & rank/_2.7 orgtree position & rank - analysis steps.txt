2.7 orgtree position & rank - steps to creating orgtree_position_rank


1.0 position_rank_
	
	Created these files from orgtree & career tables

	Esther & Jeongsu manually ranked positions

	I discovered the 통일부 기관별 인명록,
	and realized it would be better to base our orgtree on this,
	rather than on our data.

1.1 orgtree_position_rank

	I created this file using the 2022년 기관별 인명록.

	I introduced a position rank system with three levels: P1, P2, P3

	I integrated all 0. position_rank_ files into 1.0 orgtree_position_rank, 
	and use a new PI_index to code them.
		0+ series are included in 2022년 기관별 인명록
		200+ series are current orgs, but not in 2022년 기관별 인명록
		500+ series are not current orgs

2.0_mismatch_

	I then compared all positions in 0. position_rank_ df with 1.0 orgtree_position_rank

	I identified all org_positions which occured in 0. pos_rank_ but not 1.0 orgtree_pos_rank

	These were merged with career data and handcoded.

	I also introduced a new variable, InstitutionCategory.

	All 당외곽 및 사회단체 were compared with 2022년 기관별 인명록 & 2022년 기관별 인명록 (별책)


2.1 orgtree_position_rank

	This version updates orgtree_position_rank with the edits and coding
	from all of 2.0_mismatch_ files.
