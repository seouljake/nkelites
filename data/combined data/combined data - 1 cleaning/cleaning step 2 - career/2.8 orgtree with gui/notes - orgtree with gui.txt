This orgtree folder was created 2023.10.12 in order to transform the orgtree structure using a GUI:
- created in PySimpleGUI
- which allows add, delete, editing of new
- orgs & metadata (table)
- child-to-parent links, which can change over time (list)
- parent-to-child links (tree)

As the orgtree is transformed, it will also be important to:
- map (PrimaryInstitution,OrgName) pairs in LeaderCareerLink to orgtree
